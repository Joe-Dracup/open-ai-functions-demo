open-ai-functions-demo

quick demo app to showcase using open ai functions

not trying to be a great example of code quality, lots of plugging in AI generated components together

to run:

```
clone

npm i

copy sample.env into a .env file

fill in open ai key

npm run dev

```

works based on the `exampleNumber` string in Microphone.vue.

just increment this up to example 4 to see the different examples of ways this could be used
